## Description

This is an e-commerce platform that has been refactored to use Redux to handle and manage global state.

## Installation
Initialize a React application by typing `create-react-app` in the command line.

`Apollo`, `Stripe`, `GraphQL`, `jwt-decode`, `react-redux`, `bcrypt`, `dotenv`, and `Mongoose` were installed through `npm install`.

## Usage
Users can view all available products as well as product by category upon initial load of application.  Users must be logged in or sign up in order to place an order.  Once logged in, they are able to checkout and the page is redirected to `Stripe` which will handle the transaction.  Once the transaction is completed, users are redirected to the home page.
